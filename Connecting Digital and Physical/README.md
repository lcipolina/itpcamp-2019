## Description
This class is about connecting the digital world and physical world. Wouldn't it be cool to be able to control a digital sketch on your computer with potentiometers and sensors, or vice versa? :) During the class, we will learn how to do the serial communication between your Arduino and your digital sketch written in p5.js on your computer. Serial communication is one of the most common and convenient way of communicating between two devices.
