Do you think information is beautiful? Interested in open datasets? Learn how to use Python to quickly learn about a dataset, find patterns, and visualize results. We will practice making charts with NYC Open Data, and learn how to take the visualizations to the next level in Adobe Illustrator. Some programming experience would be helpful, but not necessary for participation in this workshop.
