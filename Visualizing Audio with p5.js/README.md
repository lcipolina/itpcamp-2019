## Description

Come by to learn how to create audio triggered visualization with p5.js and p5.sound.js. We will learn how to connect an audio input (such as microphone and music playing from your computer) to use its amplitude and frequency spectrum to create real-time visualization! This session will provide fundamental concepts of using audio input in p5.js and also cover some tricks that will enhance your p5.js visualizations (if you didn't know them already).
