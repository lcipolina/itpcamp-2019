Launch Weekend Workshops are single track workshops that give everyone an opportunity to gather and make together in one large space.

Our fingers are constantly swiping across touchpads, to enter passwords, navigate maps, play games, type messages. But how does this work? How are our physical interactions with materials sensed and translated into electronic signals that our computers can understand?

In this workshop we will build our own muti-touch pressure-sensitive touchpads from paper, copper tape and Velostat - a carbon impreganted plastic film with piezoresistive properties. Then we will use the visual programming environment vvvv to read our touchpad’s raw data, apply a blob detection algorithm to detect multiple touch points and do gesture recognition on this input.
