Session description: Have lots of data? You should use a database! We'll do a crash course in SQL by exploring public data about CitiBike using [Google BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery). Data processing will be so fast and easy. I will also share about how I use databases & SQL for data science/machine learning. No experience with databases or SQL will be necessary! If you know SQL already, still come by and explore data with us.
