This session will introduce you to visualization libraries and we will explore data using python and will be using libraries like matplotlib and plotly to create interactive 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualizations. The session will cover how to explore your data using visualizations and how one could get insights from them. It will be an introductory session, so even people with little or no programming background are welcome to join and learn how to play with data using built in libraries in python. There is no prerequisite for the session, although a little background in python will be helpful.
