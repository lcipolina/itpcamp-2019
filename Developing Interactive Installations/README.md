## Description

How can you use technology to transform your environment? And how can you try out interactions quickly, without getting too bogged down with code?

TouchDesigner is an excellent tool for prototyping and developing interactive experiences beyond the screen. I will show you how to take inputs from the physical world, process them, and make things turn on, light up, or move around.
